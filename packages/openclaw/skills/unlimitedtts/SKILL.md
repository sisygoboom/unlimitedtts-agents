# UnlimitedTTS

Create paid speech without handling wallet secrets. Prefer the UnlimitedTTS MCP tools. Use direct HTTP only when those tools are unavailable and a conforming x402 wallet-aware HTTP client is already present.

## MCP workflow

1. Call `tts_list_voices` when the voice is missing, ambiguous, or rejected. Use the full provider-prefixed id such as `openai_nova`.
2. Call `tts_quote` with the exact text, voice, speed, and any user-stated `maxUsdc`.
3. Check the exact amount, expiry, policy result, and user budget before signing.
4. When an external wallet tool is required, ask it to sign only `selectedRequirement` from this quote. Never request or expose a seed phrase, private key, or secret.
5. Call `tts_synthesize` once with the unchanged text, voice, speed, quote token, and returned `paymentSignature`.
6. Require `payment.settled: true`. Return or send the MP3 attachment/resource, not base64.

Treat `tts_synthesize` as irreversible and not replay-safe. Never retry `PAYMENT_OUTCOME_UNKNOWN`; inspect the wallet or settlement receipt and ask the user before any new quote or authorization.

If text exceeds 4,096 UTF-16 code units, explain that each chunk is a separate paid request and get approval for the aggregate plan before proceeding.

## Direct HTTP mode

Read [direct-x402.md](references/direct-x402.md) only when MCP tools are unavailable and the agent already has both HTTP and x402 signing capability.

Read [errors.md](references/errors.md) when a tool or API call fails.
